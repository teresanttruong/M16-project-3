# Project 3 - U.S. Restaurants

## Project Overview

Food is essential to the human body for a multitude of reasons. Food acts as an energy source, is our nutrient supply, and helps with growth and development of the human body. When the body is in need of food, we often look for the easiest, quickest option to satify our hunger.

We have created an interactive dashboard that explores all the different types of Fast Food restaurants in the United States. The primary objective of this project is to analyze the amount of fast food types there are in America.
